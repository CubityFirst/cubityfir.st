Icon-Generator
==============

Kind of like GitHub's icon generator... But cooler...

Lots of people on Github have a nifty 5x5 random icon. I just reimplemented it here.

Stuff it can do
===============

-Generates a super awesome icon based on any input

-Export said awesome icon to Imgur

-Entertain you, depending on your amusement threshold
